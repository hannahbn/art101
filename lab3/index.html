					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>We added a picture to our homepage, made ordered lists linking to our labs, and made things look nice using CSS as well as
						took screenshots and addedd them to our lab site with captions.</p>
			</div>
				
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I encountered a problem where my main homepage background and my lab background were the same and I wanted my lab 
						backgound to be different so I put in code that would override the stylesheet for my main homepage and took off the 
					background (#content {
						background-image: none;
					  }).
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>The assignment went well over all even though there were some bumps in the process. I also encoutered an error
						where I thought my site was glitching but I had just made a mistake and I figured it out. This happened a couple
					times but I was always able to eventually solve it. I had a fun time customizing my site with css and working with my partner. </p>
