// Pseudocode everyday task: Banana Bread Recipe
// Evaluate when the bananas are spoiled/over ripened. 
// If ripe, prepare ingredients and materials needed.
// In a large mixing bowl combine: cream, butter, sugar, eggs, and mashed bananas.
// In a separate bowl whisk together dry ingredients: flour, salt, and baking soda.
// Combine wet and dry ingredients; add chocolate chips, raisins or walnuts. 
// Pour mixture into loaf pan. 
// Bake loaf.
// Wait for bread to cool before cutting for best cut. 
// Enjoy bread.  


// Pseudocode high level list: BEER PONG
// Initialize the Game:
  // Create a game board with cups arranged in a triangle formation at each end.
  // Set up two teams or players.
  // Initialize game state variables, including scores and game mode.
// Start the Game Loop:
  //Create a loop that continues until the game is over.
// Render the Game Board:
  // Display the game board with cups, and possibly the ball's trajectory.
// Player Input:
  // Listen for player input to aim and throw the ball.
// Calculate the Ball's Trajectory:
  // Determine the path and motion of the ball based on player input and physics.
// Check for Ball-Cup Collisions:
  // Detect if the ball collides with any of the cups.
  // Remove the hit cup if a collision occurs, and update the score.
// Check for Game Over:
  // Check if one team reaches the winning score or if the game should end for other reasons.
// End Game:
  // Display a message indicating the winning team.
  // Ask the players if they want to play again.
