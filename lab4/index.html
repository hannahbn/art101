			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocode</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Writing pseudocode for an everyday task and for a game.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We did not encounter many problems at all. The only thing we had a small issue with was understanding exactly
						what the lab wanted us to do but we re-read it a few times and figured it out. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>The lab went really well overall and it was kinda fun figuring out how to write a these things in a way that 
						resembles code. I put in a good amount of effort into this lab and I'm happy with how it turned out.  </p>

				// Pseudocode everyday task: BANANA BREAD RECIPE
				// Evaluate when the bananas are spoiled/over ripened. 
				// If ripe, prepare ingredients and materials needed.
				// In a large mixing bowl combine: cream, butter, sugar, eggs, and mashed bananas.
				// In a separate bowl whisk together dry ingredients: flour, salt, and baking soda.
				// Combine wet and dry ingredients; add chocolate chips, raisins or walnuts. 
				// Pour mixture into loaf pan. 
				// Bake loaf.
				// Wait for bread to cool before cutting for best cut. 
				// Enjoy bread.

				// Pseudocode high level list: BEER PONG
				// Initialize the Game:
				  // Create a game board with cups arranged in a triangle formation at each end.
				  // Set up two teams or players.
				  // Initialize game state variables, including scores and game mode.
				// Start the Game Loop:
				  //Create a loop that continues until the game is over.
				// Render the Game Board:
				  // Display the game board with cups, and possibly the ball's trajectory.
				// Player Input:
				  // Listen for player input to aim and throw the ball.
				// Calculate the Ball's Trajectory:
				  // Determine the path and motion of the ball based on player input and physics.
				// Check for Ball-Cup Collisions:
				  // Detect if the ball collides with any of the cups.
				  // Remove the hit cup if a collision occurs, and update the score.
				// Check for Game Over:
				  // Check if one team reaches the winning score or if the game should end for other reasons.
				// End Game:
				  // Display a message indicating the winning team.
				  // Ask the players if they want to play again.
