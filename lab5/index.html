			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge was to get javascript to print out variables and format everything to look nice.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I was a little bit confused on using the document.writeln but I got clarification from my TA. I also had a problem 
						where my text wouldn't print on my page but I realized I had a typo and that's why it wasn't working.   </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>The assignment went pretty well overall and I encountered minimal problems. I think going over everything in the command console
						in class really helped me to understand how to do everything. </p>
