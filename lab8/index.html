			<h1>Lab 8 - Anon Functions and Callbacks</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge in this lab was to use anonymous functions and callbacks and print them to the console on our sites. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had a lot of issues using the console.log command and getting it to print ot my console. I ended up doing debugging
						and figured out the problem. I also realized I had my code running twice accidentally so I fixed that as well.  </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Overall, this lab was challenging for me but I am proud of myself for figuring it out. </p>
