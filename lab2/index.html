			<h1>Hello World</h1>
			<p>Hellooo we are Hannah and Maggie! We work really well together! We met over Instagram and that is how we became partners. 
				We have no coding experience but its ok! We are both excited to be in this class and to be learning this
				material.</p>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>We made a website with the header being Hello World and wrote a paragraph about us as partners. Then we made the website 
						look nice using CSS. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We had problems indenting the text, specifically making the text apply to only one paragraph. We could not figure
						out how to link the html and the css to prevent it from cascading and applying to the whole site. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>It was fun to work on this lab together and figure things out. It was so satisfying when we figured out a solution to a problem.
						It went well overall but we never figured out how to link the html and css which was definitely
				        our biggest issue. We put a lot of energy into this assignment and worked hard to do our best. We followed the prompt closely 
					    and looked at all of the examples as well as inspecting different websites.   </p>
