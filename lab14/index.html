					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge was to debug my lab 7 </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I struggled a bit trying to figure this out but ChatGPT ended up helping me a lot. The issue was that my prompt
						was running twice. I was able to solve this through trial and error and trying to see if I had any duplicate code.
						I also checked the console and I saw that it was running twice but it didn't help me solve it. Eventually, I turned to ChatGPT 
						and through talking back and forth, it was able to figure out what the problem was.  </p>
