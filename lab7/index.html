					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge was to use the prompt to then sort the user's name while ignoring caps and print it out. </p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We struggled with this lab a lot and had major issues getting our code to work. We weren't really sure what was wrong with it. We turned to some friends in our 
                        section for help and got it to work. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
