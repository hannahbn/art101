			<h1>Lab 10 - JavaScript for the web</h1>
			<div class="challenge-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to generate random text with the click of a button. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="problems-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We didn't have too many problems, mostly what we had trouble with was adding the generateRandomText Function 
						since it took us a while to figure out what to add. We used ChatGPT to help with this part.   </p>

			<div class="reflection-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This lab was pretty simple for us and we didn't really have many issues at all. It was cool to see the text pop up.  </p>
