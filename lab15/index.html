			<h1>Lab 15 - Ajax</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge was to call an API of our choice using AJAX and display the data on our site. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We both encountered significant problems with this lab but we were still able to fix it relatively quickly. First we tried to 
						use the code provided by Wes on the lab page but this did not have all of the things we needed to include. We still had to add a button 
					and fill in the provided code. We stuggled with the button but were able to ask ChatGPT for help. We also had issues where our code was only 
				displaying some data, not all of it so we had to try to figure out how to fix this through looking at the console and asking ChatGPT.   </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Overall, this lab was definitley challenging but I am happy we were able to do it successfully.  </p>
